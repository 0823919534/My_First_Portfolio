  <h1>Welcome to Beverley’s First Cool Webpage!</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>My Journey and Interests</h3>

  <p>Hello! My name is Beverley Tebogo Mokgadi. I’m a homeschooling mother, aspiring software developer, and passionate about creating solutions for my community.</p>
  <p>I enjoy building projects that help children in South African townships gain access to education and skills, and I love exploring new tech challenges.</p>
  <p>This webpage is my first personal project where I practice HTML, headings, paragraphs, and adding interactive content like images and links.</p>
  <p>I hope to continue improving my skills and sharing more cool projects in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
